      <description>In the post I want to give a short overview about a part of the current Rust ecosystem regarding Computer Graphics and discuss a few concepts and ideas which could make Rust more interesting in this area.
Overview While Computer Graphics is often associated with 3D rendering (real-time or offline) it covers several subfields, including: geometric modeling, animation, rendering and a few more.
In particular, real-time 3D rendering is the most healthy subfield, mostly driven by the effort of the gamedev community, resulting in the creation of quite a few different libraries:</description>
